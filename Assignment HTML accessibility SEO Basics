            <p>I didn’t go to school for nutrition. I never got a certificate. But I lost 35 pounds, gained real strength, and kept it off — by going to the gym consistently and cooking my own meals.</p>
            <p>Now, I help other women do the same with <strong>simple routines, affordable grocery lists, and no-pressure coaching</strong> — because real change happens in real life.</p>

            <h2 id="about-heading">This Isn’t Theory — It’s What Worked for Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Ronewa. Like so many women, I tried every fad diet: juice cleanses, keto without knowledge, skipping meals… and nothing stuck.</p>
            <p>Then I made two changes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I started going to the gym 4 times a week — no extremes, just consistency.</li>
                <li>I began cooking my own meals using whole ingredients, tracking portions, and staying balanced.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In 6 months, I lost weight, gained confidence, and felt healthier than ever. I didn’t need a lab or a license — I just needed to show up for myself.</p>
            <p>Now, I share what I learned so you don’t have to waste time, money, or energy on what doesn’t work.</p>
